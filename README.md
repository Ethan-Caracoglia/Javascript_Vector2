basic x and y properties as well as functions to add or subtract the vector with another vector. 
It also contains scalar multiplying, magnitude, and normalized functions for working with the 
magnitude and changing it. It does contain a function to find the angle in degrees as well as a 
function to find the dot product and the distance of this and another vector2. The Vector2 type is 
checked during any method that takes a Vector2 as a parameter.

## Purpose
